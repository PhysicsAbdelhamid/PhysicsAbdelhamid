    You may know more about me by consulting my personal webpage in the link available in the below contact section. 

  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently :
-  A Master 2 (bac+5) student at Aix-Marseille university (AMU) in FunPhys -Fundamental Physics- (2022-2023)
  
  ðŸŒ± I have completed :
-  A Master 1 at AMU (2020-2022) : because of administrative issues, I have done it in two years.
-  A Master degree at Annaba university in theoretical physics : particles and cosmology (2018-2020)
-  A bachelor degree in fundamental physics at Bouira university (2015-2018)

 âš¡ Aiming to work on and things that passionate me : 
- Neutron star E.o.S., Neutrino mass oscillation.
- Hierarchy problem and UV/IR mixing. 
- The struture and the emergence of time.
- Dark matter detection and generation.
- (primordial) gravitational waves.
- More generally: Testing and understanding Fundamental Physics.

 ðŸ”­ Associated to the field of : which doesn't mean I'am specialist of them, but would like to,
- General relativity and quantum gravity: from a conceptual understanding to numerical simulation.
- Gauge/Gravity dualities : it's application to strongly coupled systems and superconductors.
- Particle Physics Theory : Physics beyond the SM, QCD and Effective field theories.
- Yangâ€“Mills theory : it's mathematical structure and open problems.
- QFT, matrix models and Lattice (gauge) field theories.
- Physical Cosmology : whether from a numerical point of view and/or data analysis.
