    You may know more about me by consulting my personal webpage in the link available in the below contact section -still under construction sorry-. 


 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently :
-  A final year graduate student (bac+5) at Aix-Marseille university (AMU) in Fundamental Physics -FunPhys- program (2022-2023).
-  Performing a 4 months internship within the ATLAS team of CPPM on b-tagging algorithms for HL-LHC.
  
 ðŸŒ± Previously :
-  A first year M.sc degree at AMU (2020-2022) : because of administrative issues, I have done it in two years.
-  A M.Sc. degree at Annaba university in theoretical physics : particles and cosmology (2018-2020).
-  A bachelor degree in fundamental physics at Bouira university (2015-2018).

ðŸ”­ Mainly interested by the fields of :
- Particle Physics Theory : Physics beyond the SM, QCD and Effective field theories.
- QFT, matrix models and Lattice (gauge) field theories.
- Yangâ€“Mills theories : it's mathematical structure and open problems.
- General relativity and quantum gravity: from a conceptual understanding to numerical simulations.
- Gauge/Gravity dualities : it's application to strongly coupled systems and superconductors.

 âš¡ Aiming to works on/passionated by : 
- In a general point of view: Testing and understanding Fundamental Physics.
- Hierarchy problem and Neutrino mass oscillations. 
- Dark matter direct/indirect detection.
- The struture and the emergence of time.
- (primordial) gravitational waves.
